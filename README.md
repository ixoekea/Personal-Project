# Frontend Mentor Project

## _Faq Accordion_

Faq accordion is a common front-end tool for website development. This tool allows for content to be collapsible on websites.

## Features

In this project I developed an interactive About Me Faq page with clickable buttons than enables and hides the text.

Languages used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Initial Setup:

1. I created the .html document to design the layout and than incorporate the text.

2. After applying the text I used css to style the split background and changed the text format.

3. After these two steps I used Javascript to create the dom to display and hide the paragraph text.

## Debugging

After incorporating the JS, I reviewed the CSS styling and restyled it to fix the location of the <p> text.

## Challenges

- The split background took a bit of practice and research to figure out the correct size requirement and placement.

- Applying the container overtop of both backgrounds also took some time to figure out how to place it.

In both of these challenges, I had to think about what was needed for the base. I developed the background to start than I developed the container for the faq accordion. Afterwards I placed them together.

- JavaScript code required me to research and refresh on the code.
  With trial and error I found out that if i declare the image as a onclick function, I could declare this as a function and connect it to Javascript.

```sh
onclick="locationInfo()"
```

## Unresolved Bugs:

I think there is still a defect in the image displaying correctly on proper screen resolutions.
